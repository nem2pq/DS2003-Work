```{r}
# import packages

```


```{r}
# Read in income data

```

```{r}
# summary of data

```

```{r}
# change order of factor levels for 'occ' and 'edu' to be low, med, high

```

```{r}
# change 'sex' variable to male & female

```

## Barplots

```{r}
# create a bar plot that counts people with low, medium, and high occupation status respectively

```

```{r}
# Add a title, color, and theme, differentiate by sex, and total count labels over the bars (don't be afraid to google)


```

```{r}
# unstack the bars, which do you think is a better graph?
# use scale_fill_manual() to set your colors

```


```{r}
# Make the same graph with precomputed data (will need to consider changing default settings)

#pre-computed data
occ_counted <- df %>% count(occ, name = 'count') 
occ_counted

```


```{r}
# look up the function after_stat()
# create the same bar graph using percents on the y axis (use data 'df')
# update the y axis label

```


```{r}
# stacked plot with frequencies; used data occ_counted)

```

```{r}
# Try to make this plot better by using position = 'fill'
# Change your labels appropiately

  
```

## Histogram

```{r}
# Draw a histogram with the variable income

```

## Density Plot

```{r}
# plot a density plot of income

```

# Histogram with Density Plot

```{r}
# Graph the histogram and density plot together

```

## Histogram with groups

```{r}
# Create a histogram separated by sex

```

## Boxplot

```{r}
# create a boxplot for income

```

```{r}
#Remove everything on the y-axis including the texts and tick marks

```

```{r}
# Separate by sex

```

## Violin Plot

```{r}
# Create a violin plot of income separated by sex

```

```{r}
# overlay the data points and color by education

```
## Scatterplot

```{r}
# Create a scatterplot of income vs age

```


```{r}
# It is hard to see the individual data points. Plot two ways to make it easy to see individual points

```

```{r}
# show 2 ways to differentiate the points by sex

```

## Facets
```{r}
# use faceting to separate scatter plot by sex

```

```{r}
# use faceting to separate by sex and edu using facet_wrap()

```

```{r}
# use faceting to separate by sex and edu using facet_grid()

```

```{r}
# With extra time, go back through charts and practice changing colors, themes, labels, etc...

```
