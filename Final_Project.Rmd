p("Spotify as well as other music streaming platforms have become an increasingly popular way to access and listen to music. The success of a song on streaming platforms has become another way to describe the success of a music artist and an important metric to track trends in the music industry. This led us to explore this dataset, which includes the 100 top songs from spotify from years 2010-2019, and look to see if there are any trends or questions about the music industry or popular music preferences that can be answered by this data set. Investigating this data is valuable to many music platforms, because many of them use algorithms to market music to specific audiences, and predict the success of future music.
